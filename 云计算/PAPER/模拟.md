# 30 Cloud Computing Short Answer Questions

## Question 1: What is Cloud Computing according to the NIST definition?

**English Answer**: According to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**中文答案**: 根据美国国家标准与技术研究院(NIST)的定义，云计算是一种模型，它能够实现便捷的、按需的网络访问，访问一个共享的可配置计算资源池(如网络、服务器、存储、应用程序和服务)，这些资源能够被快速配置和释放，且管理开销小，几乎不需要服务提供商的干预。

## Question 2: What are the three main criteria to determine if a service is delivered in the cloud computing style?

**English Answer**: The three criteria to determine if a service is delivered in the cloud computing style are: 1) The service is accessible via a Web browser or a Web services API; 2) Zero capital expenditure is necessary to get started; 3) You pay only for what you use as you use it (pay-as-you-go model).

**中文答案**: 判断一项服务是否以云计算方式提供的三个标准是：1）该服务可通过网络浏览器（非专有）或Web服务API访问；2）开始使用时不需要资本支出；3）只为使用的资源付费（即用即付模式）。

## Question 3: What are the main deployment models for cloud computing?

**English Answer**: The main deployment models for cloud computing are: Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Community Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud. Each model differs in terms of ownership, management, access control, and resource allocation strategies.

**中文答案**: 云计算的主要部署模型有：公共云、私有云、社区云和混合云。每种模型在所有权、管理方式、访问控制和资源分配策略方面有所不同。

## Question 4: Explain the three compelling use cases that favor utility computing over conventional hosting.

**English Answer**: The three compelling use cases are: 1) When demand for a service varies with time (variable workload); 2) When demand is unknown in advance (unpredictable demand); 3) When organizations perform batch analytics and can use the "cost associativity" of cloud computing to finish computations faster by using many more resources for the same total cost.

**中文答案**: 三个有利于选择效用计算而非传统托管的使用场景是：1）当服务需求随时间变化（工作负载变化）；2）当需求无法提前预知（不可预测的需求）；3）当组织执行批处理分析时，可以利用云计算的"成本关联性"，以相同的总成本使用更多资源来更快地完成计算。

## Question 5: What is the difference between data parallelism and task parallelism?

**English Answer**: In data parallelism, the same set of tasks are performed by each core using different subsets of the same data. In task parallelism, a larger task is decomposed into multiple independent sub-tasks, which are then assigned to different cores. Data parallelism focuses on distributing data, while task parallelism focuses on distributing functions or tasks.

**中文答案**: 在数据并行中，每个核心使用相同数据的不同子集执行相同的任务集。在任务并行中，一个较大的任务被分解为多个独立的子任务，然后分配给不同的核心。数据并行关注于分配数据，而任务并行关注于分配功能或任务。

## Question 6: What is Amdahl's Law and what does it tell us about parallel processing?

**English Answer**: Amdahl's Law states that if α is the fraction of running time a sequential program spends on non-parallelizable segments of computation, then the maximum speed-up (S) possible is S = 1/α. This law tells us that there's a fundamental limit to the speedup we can achieve through parallelization, determined by the portion of the program that cannot be parallelized.

**中文答案**: 阿姆达尔定律指出，如果一个顺序程序在不可并行化的计算部分所花费的运行时间比例为α，那么可能实现的最大加速比(S)为S = 1/α。这一定律告诉我们，通过并行化可以实现的加速有一个基本限制，这个限制由程序中不能并行化的部分决定。

## Question 7: What is coarse-grained parallelism versus fine-grained parallelism?

**English Answer**: Coarse-grained parallelism involves large blocks of code that are executed before concurrent threads communicate, resulting in less frequent communication but potentially higher latency. Fine-grained parallelism involves short bursts of computations that alternate with relatively long periods when a thread waits for messages from other threads, resulting in more frequent communication but potentially lower latency.

**中文答案**: 粗粒度并行涉及在并发线程通信之前执行的大块代码，这导致通信频率较低但可能产生更高的延迟。细粒度并行涉及短时间的计算，与线程等待来自其他线程的消息的相对较长时间段交替进行，这导致更频繁的通信但可能产生更低的延迟。

## Question 8: Explain the concept of virtualization and why it's important for cloud computing.

**English Answer**: Virtualization is a technology that abstracts physical computing resources, creating virtual versions that can be used more efficiently. It enables multiple virtual systems to run on a single physical system, isolating users from one another and supporting replication. Virtualization is crucial for cloud computing because it increases resource utilization, provides isolation, enhances security, and supports elasticity by allowing resources to be allocated and deallocated dynamically.

**中文答案**: 虚拟化是一种抽象物理计算资源的技术，创建可以更有效使用的虚拟版本。它使多个虚拟系统能够在单个物理系统上运行，将用户相互隔离并支持复制。虚拟化对云计算至关重要，因为它提高了资源利用率，提供了隔离性，增强了安全性，并通过允许动态分配和释放资源来支持弹性。

## Question 9: What are the differences between process VMs and system VMs?

**English Answer**: Process VMs provide a virtual platform for individual processes and are destroyed once the process terminates. System VMs support an entire operating system together with many user processes. Process VMs are lighter and more temporary, while system VMs are more comprehensive and persistent, offering complete isolation at the OS level.

**中文答案**: 进程虚拟机为单个进程提供虚拟平台，一旦进程终止就会被销毁。系统虚拟机支持整个操作系统及其多个用户进程。进程虚拟机较轻量且更临时，而系统虚拟机更全面且持久，在操作系统级别提供完全隔离。

## Question 10: What are the advantages and disadvantages of virtualization?

**English Answer**: Advantages include managed execution, isolation, portability, reduced maintenance costs, and efficient resource use. Disadvantages include performance degradation due to the virtualization layer, potential inefficiency due to inaccessible host features, and potential security vulnerabilities introduced by virtualization technology itself.

**中文答案**: 虚拟化的优势包括受管执行、隔离性、可移植性、降低维护成本以及高效的资源利用。缺点包括由于虚拟化层而导致的性能下降、由于主机特性不可访问而可能导致的低效率，以及虚拟化技术本身可能引入的安全漏洞。

## Question 11: What is a container and how does it differ from a virtual machine?

**English Answer**: A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers differ from VMs in that they share the host system's kernel rather than having their own OS, making them more lightweight, faster to start, and more resource-efficient. However, they provide less isolation than VMs since they all use the same kernel.

**中文答案**: 容器是一个轻量级、独立的、可执行的包，包含运行软件所需的一切：代码、运行时、系统工具、库和设置。容器与虚拟机的不同之处在于它们共享主机系统的内核而不是拥有自己的操作系统，这使它们更轻量级、启动更快且资源利用更高效。然而，由于它们都使用相同的内核，所以它们提供的隔离性不如虚拟机。

## Question 12: What are Linux Namespaces and Control Groups (cgroups), and how do they enable container isolation?

**English Answer**: Linux Namespaces ensure each process sees its own personal view of the system (files, processes, network interfaces, hostname, etc.), creating isolation at different levels. Control Groups (cgroups) limit the amount of resources a process can consume (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, etc.). Together, these two mechanisms enable containers to be isolated from each other and from the host system, while still sharing the host's kernel.

**中文答案**: Linux命名空间确保每个进程看到自己的系统视图（文件、进程、网络接口、主机名等），在不同层面创建隔离。控制组（cgroups）限制进程可以消耗的资源量（CPU、内存、网络带宽等）。这两种机制共同使容器能够彼此隔离并与主机系统隔离，同时仍共享主机的内核。

## Question 13: What is Docker and what are its three main concepts?

**English Answer**: Docker is a platform for packaging, distributing, and running applications in containers. Its three main concepts are: 1) Images - packaged applications with their environments; 2) Registries - repositories that store Docker images; 3) Containers - running instances of Docker images, providing isolated environments for applications.

**中文答案**: Docker是一个用于打包、分发和在容器中运行应用程序的平台。它的三个主要概念是：1）镜像 - 打包的应用程序及其环境；2）注册表 - 存储Docker镜像的仓库；3）容器 - Docker镜像的运行实例，为应用程序提供隔离环境。

## Question 14: Explain the concept of Docker image layers.

**English Answer**: Docker images are composed of multiple read-only layers, where each layer represents a set of changes to the filesystem. Different images can share identical layers, which makes distribution and storage more efficient. When a container runs, a new writable layer is created on top of the image layers. This layered approach allows for faster distribution of images across networks and reduces storage requirements since common layers are stored only once.

**中文答案**: Docker镜像由多个只读层组成，每层代表文件系统的一组变更。不同的镜像可以共享相同的层，这使分发和存储更高效。当容器运行时，会在镜像层之上创建一个新的可写层。这种分层方法允许在网络上更快地分发镜像，并减少存储需求，因为共同的层只存储一次。

## Question 15: What is Kubernetes and what problem does it solve?

**English Answer**: Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It solves the problem of managing containerized applications at scale by providing a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. Kubernetes abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, making it easier to deploy and manage applications regardless of the environment, enabling developers to focus on application development rather than operations.

**中文答案**: Kubernetes是一个开源平台，旨在自动化应用容器的部署、扩展和操作。它通过提供一个框架来弹性地运行分布式系统，解决了大规模管理容器化应用的问题。Kubernetes抽象了底层基础设施，使得无论在什么环境中都能更容易地部署和管理应用，使开发人员能够专注于应用开发而非运维。

## Question 16: What are Pods in Kubernetes and why are they important?

**English Answer**: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes that can be created, scheduled, and managed. A pod encapsulates one or more containers, storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run. Pods are important because they provide a higher level of abstraction for container management, allowing multiple related containers to be treated as a single unit, sharing resources and facilitating communication between them.

**中文答案**: Pod是Kubernetes中可以创建、调度和管理的最小部署单元。一个pod封装了一个或多个容器、存储资源、唯一的网络IP以及控制容器如何运行的选项。Pod之所以重要，是因为它们为容器管理提供了更高级别的抽象，允许将多个相关容器作为单个单元处理，共享资源并促进它们之间的通信。

## Question 17: What criteria should be considered when deciding whether to use multiple containers in a single pod?

**English Answer**: When deciding whether to use multiple containers in a single pod, you should consider: 1) Whether the containers need to be run together or can run on different hosts; 2) Whether they represent a single whole or are independent components; 3) Whether they must be scaled together or individually. Generally, containers should be in the same pod if they are tightly coupled, need to share resources, and have the same lifecycle.

**中文答案**: 在决定是否在单个pod中使用多个容器时，应考虑：1）这些容器是否需要一起运行，或者可以在不同的主机上运行；2）它们是代表一个整体还是独立的组件；3）它们是必须一起扩展还是可以单独扩展。通常，如果容器紧密耦合、需要共享资源且具有相同的生命周期，则应将它们放在同一个pod中。

## Question 18: What is a ReplicationController in Kubernetes and how does it differ from a ReplicaSet?

**English Answer**: A ReplicationController is a Kubernetes resource that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. If pods fail or are deleted, the ReplicationController replaces them automatically. A ReplicaSet is a next-generation ReplicationController that provides more flexible pod selection capabilities. The key difference is that ReplicaSets support more expressive pod selectors using set-based matching, while ReplicationControllers only support equality-based selectors.

**中文答案**: ReplicationController是Kubernetes中的一种资源，确保在任何给定时间都运行指定数量的pod副本。如果pod失败或被删除，ReplicationController会自动替换它们。ReplicaSet是下一代ReplicationController，提供更灵活的pod选择功能。主要区别在于ReplicaSet支持使用基于集合的匹配进行更具表现力的pod选择，而ReplicationController仅支持基于相等性的选择器。

## Question 19: What is MapReduce and what are its key components?

**English Answer**: MapReduce is a programming model designed for processing large datasets across distributed systems. Its key components are: 1) The Map function, which processes input key-value pairs to generate intermediate key-value pairs; 2) The Reduce function, which merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. This model allows for parallel processing of data, where the mapping and reducing tasks can be distributed across multiple machines.

**中文答案**: MapReduce是一种设计用于在分布式系统中处理大型数据集的编程模型。其关键组件是：1）Map函数，处理输入键值对以生成中间键值对；2）Reduce函数，合并与相同中间键关联的所有中间值。这种模型允许数据的并行处理，其中映射和归约任务可以分布在多台机器上。

## Question 20: What are the two main phases of a MapReduce computation?

**English Answer**: The two main phases of a MapReduce computation are: 1) Analysis phase - operates directly on the input file and corresponds to the operation performed by the map task, executed in parallel; 2) Aggregation phase - operates on the intermediate results and is characterized by operations aimed at aggregating, summing, and/or elaborating the data obtained at the previous stage to present it in its final form, performed by the reduce function.

**中文答案**: MapReduce计算的两个主要阶段是：1）分析阶段 - 直接对输入文件进行操作，对应于map任务执行的操作，并行执行；2）聚合阶段 - 对中间结果进行操作，特点是通过reduce函数进行聚合、求和和/或进一步处理上一阶段获得的数据，以呈现其最终形式。

## Question 21: What is serverless computing and what are its key characteristics?

**English Answer**: Serverless computing is a cloud service model where cloud providers manage the server infrastructure and dynamically allocate resources based on application needs. Its key characteristics include: auto-scaling, event-driven architecture, statelessness, transparent development, pay-as-you-go pricing, and typically short but variable execution times. It allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management.

**中文答案**: 无服务器计算是一种云服务模型，云提供商管理服务器基础设施并根据应用需求动态分配资源。其关键特点包括：自动缩放、事件驱动架构、无状态性、透明开发、按使用付费定价，以及通常短但可变的执行时间。它允许开发人员专注于编写代码，而无需担心基础设施管理。

## Question 22: What is the difference between Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) in serverless computing?

**English Answer**: In serverless computing, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) allows developers to execute code in response to events without managing infrastructure; it focuses on executing individual functions or microservices. Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provides pre-built backend services such as databases, authentication, and storage, eliminating the need to build these components from scratch. Together, FaaS and BaaS form the complete serverless computing model.

**中文答案**: 在无服务器计算中，Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)允许开发者响应事件执行代码而无需管理基础设施；它专注于执行单个函数或微服务。Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)提供预构建的后端服务，如数据库、身份验证和存储，消除了从头构建这些组件的需要。FaaS和BaaS共同构成了完整的无服务器计算模型。

## Question 23: What are the common challenges of serverless computing?

**English Answer**: Common challenges of serverless computing include: cold start latency when scaling to zero; limited execution time (often capped at 15 minutes); difficulty in testing and debugging; vendor lock-in; limited intra-function parallelism; statelessness requiring external storage for persistence; and potential higher costs for long-running applications with steady workloads compared to traditional server deployments.

**中文答案**: 无服务器计算的常见挑战包括：扩展到零时的冷启动延迟；有限的执行时间（通常上限为15分钟）；测试和调试困难；供应商锁定；有限的函数内并行性；无状态性需要外部存储来实现持久性；以及与传统服务器部署相比，对于具有稳定工作负载的长时间运行应用可能产生更高的成本。

## Question 24: What is cloud elasticity and why is it important?

**English Answer**: Cloud elasticity is the ability of a cloud system to automatically provision and de-provision resources as needed to match the current demand. It's important because it allows businesses to efficiently scale resources up during peak demand and scale down during periods of low usage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency while maintaining performance. Elasticity differs from scalability in that it focuses on dynamic resource adjustment rather than just the ability to handle increased load.

**中文答案**: 云弹性是云系统根据需求自动配置和取消配置资源的能力。它之所以重要，是因为它允许企业在需求高峰期有效地扩大资源，并在使用率低的时期缩减资源，确保最佳资源利用率和成本效率，同时保持性能。弹性与可扩展性的不同之处在于，它专注于动态资源调整，而不仅仅是处理增加负载的能力。

## Question 25: What is the pay-as-you-go model in cloud computing and how does it differ from traditional resource renting?

**English Answer**: The pay-as-you-go model in cloud computing is a pricing strategy where users only pay for the resources they actually consume, measured at a fine granularity (often per second or minute). This differs from traditional resource renting, where users pay a negotiated cost to have a resource over a fixed time period, regardless of actual usage. The pay-as-you-go model allows for more precise cost alignment with actual resource consumption and eliminates upfront capital expenditure.

**中文答案**: 云计算中的按需付费模式是一种定价策略，用户只需为他们实际消耗的资源付费，以细粒度（通常每秒或每分钟）计量。这与传统的资源租赁不同，在传统模式下，用户支付协商好的成本来在固定时间段内拥有资源，无论实际使用情况如何。按需付费模式允许成本与实际资源消耗更精确地对齐，并消除了前期资本支出。

## Question 26: What are the challenges in cloud resource management?

**English Answer**: Challenges in cloud resource management include: unpredictable workloads and fluctuating demands; maintaining quality of service while optimizing resource utilization; ensuring energy efficiency; implementing effective admission control; managing the balance between overprovisioning and elasticity; dealing with the complexity of resource allocation across diverse applications; handling failures and attacks; and scaling systems effectively while maintaining performance.

**中文答案**: 云资源管理的挑战包括：不可预测的工作负载和波动的需求；在优化资源利用率的同时保持服务质量；确保能源效率；实施有效的准入控制；管理过度配置和弹性之间的平衡；处理跨不同应用程序的资源分配复杂性；处理故障和攻击；以及在保持性能的同时有效扩展系统。

## Question 27: What are horizontal scaling and vertical scaling in cloud computing?

**English Answer**: Horizontal scaling (scaling out) involves adding more machines or instances to a system to handle increased load, distributing the workload across multiple resources. Vertical scaling (scaling up) involves adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. Horizontal scaling is generally more flexible and resilient but may require application redesign to support distributed processing, while vertical scaling is simpler but limited by the maximum capacity of a single machine.

**中文答案**: 水平扩展（横向扩展）涉及向系统添加更多机器或实例以处理增加的负载，将工作负载分布在多个资源上。垂直扩展（纵向扩展）涉及向现有机器添加更多功率（CPU、RAM）。水平扩展通常更灵活、更具弹性，但可能需要重新设计应用程序以支持分布式处理，而垂直扩展更简单，但受单台机器最大容量的限制。

## Question 28: What is the role of control theory in optimal cloud resource management?

**English Answer**: Control theory provides a mathematical framework for designing systems that regulate cloud resources based on feedback. In cloud resource management, it helps create adaptive systems that can: maintain desired performance levels despite changing workloads; ensure stability by returning to desired states after disturbances; optimize resource allocation based on multiple objectives; predict system behavior through modeling; and handle uncertainties. Controllers use feedback about current system state and estimates of future disturbances to compute optimal resource allocations.

**中文答案**: 控制理论为基于反馈设计系统提供了数学框架，用于调节云资源。在云资源管理中，它有助于创建自适应系统，可以：尽管工作负载变化，仍保持所需的性能水平；通过在干扰后返回期望状态来确保稳定性；基于多个目标优化资源分配；通过建模预测系统行为；并处理不确定性。控制器使用有关当前系统状态的反馈和对未来干扰的估计来计算最佳资源分配。

## Question 29: What are energy-proportional systems and why are they important for cloud computing?

**English Answer**: Energy-proportional systems are computing systems that consume power in proportion to their workload—using no power when idle, very little power under light load, and more power as the load increases. They're important for cloud computing because they maximize energy efficiency across all levels of utilization, reducing operational costs and environmental impact. This is particularly critical for data centers, which traditionally consume significant power even when underutilized, accounting for a growing percentage of global electricity consumption.

**中文答案**: 能耗比例系统是按照工作负载比例消耗电力的计算系统——闲置时不消耗电力，轻负载下消耗很少电力，随着负载增加而消耗更多电力。它们对云计算很重要，因为它们在所有利用水平上最大化能源效率，降低运营成本和环境影响。这对数据中心尤为重要，因为传统上，即使在未充分利用时，数据中心也会消耗大量电力，占全球电力消耗的越来越大的比例。

## Question 30: What is modularity in distributed systems and what are the differences between soft modularity and enforced modularity?

**English Answer**: Modularity in distributed systems is the organization of a system into components with well-defined functions and interfaces. Soft modularity divides a program into modules that call each other using shared memory or procedure calls, hiding implementation details but keeping modules in the same address space. Enforced modularity (like client-server architecture) forces modules to interact only through message passing, providing better isolation, fault tolerance, and security. While soft modularity is simpler, enforced modularity is more robust against failures and security threats.

**中文答案**: 分布式系统中的模块化是将系统组织成具有明确定义的功能和接口的组件。软模块化将程序分成使用共享内存或过程调用相互调用的模块，隐藏实现细节但将模块保持在相同的地址空间中。强制模块化（如客户端-服务器架构）强制模块仅通过消息传递进行交互，提供更好的隔离、容错性和安全性。虽然软模块化更简单，但强制模块化对故障和安全威胁更具鲁棒性。
